## Source Material

### Primary Textbooks (per CAS Syllabus)
1. **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** by James, Gareth, et al.
   - Recommended: Work through lab exercises at end of chapters for better understanding
   - Note: R programming knowledge helpful but not required
2. **Dobson and Barnett** - Covers Extended Linear Models section
3. **Tse** - Referenced for certain topics (also used in MAS-II)

### Supplementary Materials
- **Schaum's Outline Series** - Listed for Sections B and C as study aids (no expansion of material)

### Study Manual Providers
- **ACTEX Learning** - CAS Exam MAS-I Study Manual with instructional videos
- **ASM (Actuarial Study Materials)** - Study manual program for CAS Exam MAS-I
- **Coaching Actuaries** - MAS-I preparation materials and practice platform
- **The Infinite Actuary (TIA)** - CAS Exam MAS-I course materials

## Exam Topics

The exam covers three main sections:

### Section A: Probability Models
- **Stochastic Processes**
  - Poisson processes
  - Markov chains
  - Discrete and continuous time models
- **Survival Models**
  - Parametric survival distributions
  - Hazard functions
  - Censoring and truncation

### Section B: Statistics
- Point estimation
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Bayesian inference
- Bootstrap methods

### Section C: Extended Linear Models
- Linear regression
- Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
- Model selection and validation
- Diagnostic techniques
- Residual analysis

## Programming Knowledge

**Important**: Candidates who become familiar with a statistical language capable of generating statistical output, such as **R**, will have an easier time understanding and applying the concepts.

**Note**: Candidates will **NOT** be asked to write or interpret R code on exam questions, but familiarity with statistical computing concepts is beneficial.

## Study Tips

- Average study time: 300-400 hours
- This is typically the first CAS-specific exam (after P and FM)
- Strong emphasis on statistical theory and applications
- GLMs are heavily tested - ensure deep understanding
- Work through textbook exercises, especially James et al. lab exercises
- Practice interpreting statistical output even without coding
- Build foundation in both frequency/severity models and regression techniques
